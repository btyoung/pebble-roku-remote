==================
Pebble Roku Remote
==================

This application allows the user to control a ROKU media device from your
wrist. The desire is to be optimized to use as few clicks as possible for the
most common functions. Play/Pause will be available with a single click after
startup. 

The app interface works by specifying a set of 3 commands in multiple columns.
With a column selected, the three keys (Up, Select, Down) line up with the
three commands. To change columns, either click two buttons or perform a a long
click.

The columns are:

- Play, Rev, Fwd
- Home, Back, Select
- Left, Right Info
- Up, Down, InstantReplay
- Backspace, Search, Enter

It is expected that you normally only use a single Roku, so the IP will be
configurable on the phone, but not directly on the watch.
